This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AnalyticsCore is a Swift Package Manager library that provides a simple, consistent way to track analytics across iOS and watchOS applications. It's designed to avoid analytics bloat by focusing on key business events (onboarding, paywall interactions, feature usage, and screen views) that move the needle while keeping complexity and costs down.

The library wraps Amplitude as the analytics backend and uses CocoaLumberjack for logging.

## Commands

### Building
```bash
swift build
```

### Running Tests
```bash
swift test
```

### Running a Single Test
```bash
swift test --filter <TestName>
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **AnalyticsManager** (Sources/AnalyticsCore/AnalyticsManager.swift): Central singleton that manages Amplitude configuration and event tracking. Must be initialized with `setup(apiKey:)` before use. Configured for EU server zone with automatic screen view capture. Events are flushed immediately in DEBUG builds for testing.

- **AnalyticsEvent Protocol** (Sources/AnalyticsCore/Events/AnalyticsEvent.swift): All events conform to this protocol with `name` and `properties`. Also defines `AnalyticsUserProperty` protocol (note: there's a syntax error on line 6 - missing protocol name).

### Event Types

The library provides four canned event types in `Sources/AnalyticsCore/Events/`:

1. **Paywall** - Tracks subscription/purchase flow (shown, dismissed, purchase started/completed, restore). Requires `source` parameter; logs warning if missing on non-watchOS platforms. Supports `period` property for completed purchases.

2. **Onboarding** - Tracks onboarding progress with custom step names, formatted as `[Onboarding] {step}`.

3. **ScreenView** - Simple screen view tracking (though Amplitude autocaptures these by default).

4. **FeatureUse** - Public struct for tracking feature usage with title and optional properties. The only event type marked `public` for external use.

### Platform Support

- iOS 15+
- watchOS 9+

### Key Design Decisions

- Events use a naming convention with brackets: `[Paywall]`, `[Onboarding]`
- Debug builds flush events immediately for testing; production builds batch
- CocoaLumberjack logs all events with üìç emoji for easy filtering
- Paywall events without a source trigger a warning (‚ö†Ô∏è) on iOS but not watchOS
- Most event structs are internal; only `FeatureUse` and `AnalyticsUserProperty` are public
